  <h2>About Fountain School Transport System</h2>
  <p>
    Fountain School is committed to providing safe, reliable, and efficient transportation 
    for all our students. Our school buses cover five major routes: Ngarariga, Kinyogori, 
    Nyambare, Limuru, and Ndeiya. Each bus is supervised by a dedicated teacher 
    (acting as a bus conductor) to ensure the safety and discipline of every child on board.
  </p>
  <p>
    This transport system was developed to simplify route assignments, improve accountability, 
    and keep track of buses, teachers, and students. Through our online portal, admins can 
    easily manage routes, assign teachers, and monitor bus status in real-time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to make school transport safe, organized, and transparent â€” giving 
    parents, teachers, and students peace of mind.
